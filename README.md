A journey with Cindy and Aaron as we attempt to predict COVID-19 flare ups in various states of the US
Step 1: Prediction Model using ML in one state
Step 2: Find effective features in preventative measures ie. higher negative coefficients
Step 3: Prediction Model using ML for US
Step 4: Prediction Model using ML for individual cities/world
Step 5: Add in political data ?
Step 6:
Step *: Use Neural Networks to predict models
